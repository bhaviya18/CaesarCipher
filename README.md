# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Java Program

A simple Java command-line application that implements the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the earliest known encryption techniques. This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift key.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Encrypts plain text with a Caesar shift and saves the result to a file
- ✅ Decrypts user-entered ciphertext using a known shift key
- ✅ Menu-driven interface with an option to exit
- ✅ Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, and preserves symbols and spaces
